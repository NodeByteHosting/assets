## What is a reverse proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and a target server. It forwards client requests to the target server and returns responses to the client. This setup provides several benefits, including load balancing, enhanced security, and performance optimization.

## Why Use a Reverse Proxy for Minecraft?
Using a reverse proxy for your Minecraft server can offer several advantages:

- **Traffic Management**: The reverse proxy can handle and route traffic efficiently.
- **Security**: The reverse proxy can add an extra layer of protection by filtering requests.
- **Performance**: Load balancing can improve your server's performance and responsiveness.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your reverse proxy setup, consider the following:

- **Check your proxy settings**: Verify that the target server address and port are correct.
- **Firewall and port issues**: Ensure your firewall is not blocking the reverse proxy traffic.
- **Cloudflare compatibility**: If you use [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), ensure [the reverse proxy and Cloudflare settings](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/setting-up-minecraft-srv-records-on-cloudflare-connect-via-your-domain-name/636757) are compatible.
