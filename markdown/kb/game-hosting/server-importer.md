# Overview

The Server Importer helps you move from your previous host over to us, this will bring all your files/folders over meaning you do not need to start again from scratch!

# How to use the Server Importer

Your previous host must support FTP/SFTP access for you to be able to do this!

Using the importer is easy! We do not store any of the data from using this feature. 

You will need to fill in:

- Host (The Server SFTP/FTP address)
- Port (SFTP: 22 FTP: 21)
- Username
- Password

You can leave the "From" and "To" blank if you like!

Once you have filled out the options click on "Test" to test the connection.
