## How to access your VPS

Once the setup is complete you should get an email from vps@nodebyte.host containing your IP, Port, User and Password. 

It will look like this:

Use any Terminal you would like (As long as it supports SSH access). 

For this example we are using [Termius](https://termius.com/)

When you load up your SSH client click fill in the details required to connect.

For command line the command to connect is:
```
ssh {username}@{IP}
```

On Termius it will be like this:

Once your details are entered click on "Connect" you will then be greeted by your own VPS to do what you need to do.
